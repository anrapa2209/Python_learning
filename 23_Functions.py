#better way to organize our code by breaking our code into
#smaller, more manageable, more maintainable chunks called functions.
def greet_user():               #def stands for define, greet_user is the discreet function name

print("Start")          #add 2 line breaks after the function
greet_user()            #always define the functions first and then, call them
